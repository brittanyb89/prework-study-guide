# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was created to provide a place to keep all notes from bootcamp in one convenient place. I built this project so that myself and other bootcamp students could access notes and topics that are gone over throughout bootcamp. This solves the problem of writing notes that you later do not understand and being able to get notes on each topic outside of class to use as a guide for research and studying purposes. What I learned from this was how to successfully develop a webpage and deploy it to website so that anyone can see it. I learned the importance of each coding language, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and how that impact the quality of a webpage. Understanding this would make me a strong future Web Developer.

## Usage

To use this Prework Study Guide, you can review the notes in each section. For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
